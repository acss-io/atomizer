By default, no configuration file is necessary for Atomizer to run. Atomizer will automatically parse the files passed in and generate the CSS file for you.

However, in most cases, you will need to customize Atomizer to fit your projects requirements. This guide will help define the configuration options available for Atomizer.

## Create a configuration file

Create a file named `atomizer.config.js` in the directory of your choosing with the following contents:

```js
module.exports = {
    breakPoints: {},
    classNames: {},
    custom: {},
};
```

<p class="noteBox info">The name of the file is arbitrary as this will be passed into Atomizer at build time.</p>

How you use this file depends on your project setup, please refer to the [installation guide](./installation.html) for more info.

Next, read the config sections below to learn more about the configuration options available.

## Configuration options

### Breakpoints

The `breakpoints` section defines the [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) your templates will use when using the [breakpoint suffix](./guides/syntax.html#breakpoint_identifier) or [automatic breakpoints](./guides/syntax.html#automatic-breakpoints).

```js
module.exports = {
    breakPoints: {
        sm: '@media screen and (min-width: 700px)',
        md: '@media screen and (min-width: 999px)',
        lg: '@media screen and (min-width: 1200px)',
    },
};
```

Read more about how break points work from our [Breakpoints guide](./breakpoints.html).

### Classnames

`classNames` is the list of Atomizer class names your project uses. You do not have to explictly declare them like this since Atomizer can parse any file and create this list automatically for you.  However, you always have the option to explicitly declare classnames if you find it helpful for your project.

```js
module.exports = {
    classNames: [
        'H(uh)',
        'C(primary)',
    }
}
```

### Custom

The `custom` section maps custom suffixes to values and it is specially useful for theming or things that you need to change globally in many different Atomizer classes. These key/value pairs map to the custom suffixes in `classNames`.

For example, given the configuration below:

```js
module.exports = {
    custom: {
        uh: '79px',
        primary: '#f6a1e1',
    },
    classNames: [
        'H(uh)',
        'C(primary)',
    },
};
```

The `H(uh)` will get `height: 79px` and `C(primary)` will get color: `#f6a1e1`.

#### Substitution

Custom values may also be substituted into one another via the `#{}` syntax, which are resolved recursively.

 ```js
module.exports = {
    custom: {
        padding: '#{standardPadding} 5px #{standardPadding} 20px',
        standardPadding: '10px',
    }
};
 ```

### Exclude

This is the opposite of the [classNames](#classnames). There are cases that you may want to tell Atomizer to ignore class names already defined in `classNames`. This is useful when classes are automatically added by the parser or when you want to create different atomic CSS files from the same set of `classNames`.

```js
module.exports = {
    exclude: [
        'Fl(end)',
    ];
}
```
