If your project calls for an Atomic CSS library, make sure to give it a try. And if you think you don't like the syntax, <a href=\"https://github.com/acss-io/atomizer/discussions/429\">think again</a>!"

It took 5 - 6 months to realize that Atomizer was the best and true CSS framework which solves many problems we were facing. Thierry Koblentz helped me a lot to understand the concept and the reason behind their decisions to build Atomizer."
