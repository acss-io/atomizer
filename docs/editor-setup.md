Atomizer automatically scans your project for Atomic CSS class names. No configuration or packages are needed to work in your favorite editor. However, we provide extensions for VS Code to help improve your developer experience.

If you have a configuration setup or editor extension that you want to share, please [let us know](./support.html); we will include it here.

## Extensions for VS Code

### Atomic CSS Snippets

The easiest way to integrate with VS Code is to install our [Atomic CSS Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acss-io.atomic-css-snippets) extension.
