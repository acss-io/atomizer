# atomizer-plugins > vite

## Run the example

Assuming you installed the dependencies at the root of the repository, you can generate the CSS via the following run script:

```shell
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Vite will run in `watch` mode and auto re-compile changes. Open the `index.html` in your browser to see the example.

## Files

-   `index.html` - HTML page to execute the Vite bundled assets
-   `index.js` - Simulates creating HTML via JS with Atomizer CSS classes included
