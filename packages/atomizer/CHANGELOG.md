```html
<!-- image-orientation: from-image -->
<img class="Ior(fi)" />
```

##### `image-rendering`

The `image-rendering` CSS property sets an image scaling algorithm. The property applies to an element itself, to any images set in its other properties, and to its descendants.

```html
<!-- image-rendering: crisp-edges -->
<img class="Iren(ce)" />
```

#### Interactivity

##### `accent-color`

The `accent-color` CSS property sets the accent color for user-interface controls generated by some elements.

```html
<input type="checkbox" checked class="Acc(red)" />
```

##### `caret-color`

The `caret-color` CSS property sets the color of the insertion caret, the visible marker where the next character typed will be inserted.

```html
<input value="This field uses a custom caret color!" class="Cac(red)" />
```

##### `print-color-adjust`

The `print-color-adjust` CSS property sets what, if anything, the user agent may do to optimize the appearance of the element on the output device.

```html
<!-- print-color-adjust: exact -->
<div class="Pca(ex)">
  <p>Need more contrast!</p>
</div>
```

##### `touch-action`

The `touch-action` CSS property sets how an element's region can be manipulated by a touchscreen user (for example, by zooming features built into the browser).

```html
<!-- touch-action: pinch-zoom -->
<div class="Tcha(pz)">Some interactive thing</div>
```

##### `will-change`

The `will-change` CSS property hints to browsers how an element is expected to change. Browsers may set up optimizations before an element is actually changed.

```html
<!-- will-change: scroll-position -->
<div class="Wc(sp)">Some content with overflow-scroll</div>
```

#### Layout

##### `box-decoration-break`

The `box-decoration-break` CSS property specifies how an element's fragments should be rendered when broken across multiple lines, columns, or pages.

##### `object-position`

The `object-position` CSS property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element's contents within the element's box.

```html
<!-- object-position: center -->
<img class="Objp(c)" src="logo.svg" alt="Logo" />
```

##### `place-content`

The `place-content` CSS shorthand property allows you to align content along both the block and inline directions at once (i.e. the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties) in a relevant layout system such as Grid or Flexbox.

```html
<div class="D(f) Flw(w) Pc(fe,c)">
  <!-- place-content: flex-end, center -->
  <div class="small">Lorem</div>
  <div class="small">Lorem<br />ipsum</div>

  <div class="large">Lorem<br />ipsum</div>
  <div class="large"></div>
  <div class="large"></div>
</div>
```

##### `place-items`

The CSS `place-items` shorthand property allows you to align items along both the block and inline directions at once (i.e. the `align-items` and `justify-items` properties) in a relevant layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. If the second value is not set, the first value is also used for it.

```html
<div class="D(f) Pi(st)">
  <!-- place-items: stretch -->
  <div class="small">Lorem</div>
  <div class="small">Lorem<br />ipsum</div>
  <div class="large">Lorem</div>
  <div class="large">Lorem<br />ipsum</div>
  <div class="large"></div>
  <div class="large"></div>
</div>
```

##### `place-self`

The `place-self` CSS shorthand property allows you to align an individual item in both the block and inline directions at once (i.e. the `align-self` and `justify-self` properties) in a relevant layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. If the second value is not present, the first value is also used for it.

```html
<article class="D(g)">
  <span>First</span>
  <span class="Ps(s,c)">Second</span>
  <!-- place-self: start, center -->
  <span class="Ps(c,s)">Third</span>
  <!-- place-self: center, start -->
  <span class="Ps(e)">Fourth</span>
  <!-- place-self: end -->
</article>
```

#### Outline

Added support for `outline-color`, `outline-style`, and `outline-width` properties.

```html
<div class="Oc(red) Os(d) Ow(m)">Error!</div>
```

#### Typography

##### `font-kerning`

The `font-kerning` CSS property sets the use of the kerning information stored in a font.

```html
<!-- font-kerning: auto -->
<p class="Kf(a)">Hello World!</p>
```

##### `font-stretch`

The `font-stretch` CSS property selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font.

```html
<!-- font-stretch: expanded -->
<p class="Fst(e)">Hello World!</p>
```

##### `orphans`

The `orphans` CSS property sets the minimum number of lines in a block container that must be shown at the bottom of a page, region, or column.

```html
<div class="Orp(2)">
  <p>This is the first paragraph containing some text.</p>
  <p>
    This is the second paragraph containing some more text than the first one.
    It is used to demonstrate how orphans work.
  </p>
</div>
```

##### `widows`

The `widows` CSS property sets the minimum number of lines in a block container that must be shown at the top of a page, region, or column.

```html
<div class="Wid(1)">
  <p>This is the first paragraph containing some text.</p>
  <p>
    This is the second paragraph containing some more text than the first one.
    It is used to demonstrate how widows work.
  </p>
</div>
```

##### `writing-mode`

The `writing-mode` CSS property sets whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically, as well as the direction in which blocks progress.

## 3.3.5

## 3.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: Fixes fatal error when a class uses an undefined custom value and `!important`

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: In order to ensure better compatibility with old IE browsers, selectors containing escaped colons (eg, classes that use pseudo classes/elements) no longer have their declarations combined with other selectors. This due to the fact that IE < 8 will ignore the entire declaration block if any one of the selectors in that declaration contain an escaped colon.
- feat: Added the closing curly brace (`}`) as a valid boundary character when parsing input files for Atomic classnames. This is particularly helpful when working with template languages such as Dust.

First alpha release of 2.0 includes:

- General configuration is no longer passed in the `config` property of the config object. Instead, the values previously found within that object are now considered "options".
- `defaults` options/config was not being used, and has been removed from examples. We'll see if it makes a comeback at some point.

Still to come in future alpha releases:

- Enhanced breakpoint support
- Pseudo-class support
- Contextual selector support?
