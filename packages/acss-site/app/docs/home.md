## Atomic CSS is not opinionated

Atomic CSS does not contain UI components nor a grid system. It is a solution that allows you to to create **your own UI** while preventing bloat.

## Atomic CSS has no footprint

Atomic CSS's "footprint" is limited to what a project uses - meaning there is no "entry cost". Simply installing [Atomizer](atomizer.html) in your project does not add any bytes to your pages.

## Atomic CSS is Gzip-friendly

Atomic CSS creates more redundancy in the markup than "semantic" classes; and more repetition means better compression ratio. From a few tests we ran, itâ€™s about 35% for semantic classes versus 48% for Atomic classes.

## Atomic CSS is libraries best-friend

Atomic CSS is the perfect solution for common template and component libraries such as:

<div class="SpaceBetween">
    <img src="//l.yimg.com/os/acss/images/react.0db208c6.svg" alt="React" width="100" />
    <img src="//l.yimg.com/os/acss/images/ember.d3987566.svg" alt="Ember" width="100" />
    <img src="//l.yimg.com/os/acss/images/handlebars.462656ed.svg" alt="Handlebars" width="100" />
    <img src="//l.yimg.com/os/acss/images/dust.7a19cae5.svg" alt="Dust" width="100" />
</div>
